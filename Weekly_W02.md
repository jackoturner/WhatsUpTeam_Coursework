| **Accomplishments Last Week** | • Team app scaffold reviewed and adopted as the dev model (React + FastAPI + MySQL, Docker Compose, modular monolith)<br>• Dev organisation settled: front/back split — React/TS UI (`src/frontend`), FastAPI API (`src/backend`), MySQL (`infrastructure`), one Docker Compose stack<br>• OWASP baseline drafted: 37 security requirements (ASVS-mapped) + 16-scenario ethical hacking plan (WSTG-mapped), with CVSS workflow<br>• Personal workshop restructured (code + installation at root, simplified doc tree)<br>• Way of Working v2 (simplified)<br>• Design docs merged into one Blueprint |
| **Action Items for This Week** | • Group ratification of Way of Working v2 + stack decision<br>• B1 skeleton and authentication started<br>• A1 STRIDE threat model preparation (attack surface from the Blueprint) |
| **Action Items for Next Week** | • B1-B2 progress<br>• A1 STRIDE session on the deployed app once B4 lands<br>• First evidence captures filed same-day |

## Project organisation (simplified 2026-11-04)

One rule: **application code at the root, one flat document per topic.**

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| `src/frontend/` | React + TypeScript UI (screens, features, services) — the only container the browser talks to (`127.0.0.1:3000`) |
| `src/backend/` | FastAPI API in an MVC layout (controllers, models, views) — all application logic lives here |
| `infrastructure/` | MySQL image + init scripts — internal Docker network only, never exposed to the host |
| `compose.yaml` | One command runs it all (`npm run dev`); the frontend's nginx proxies `/api/` to the backend, so front and back share one origin |
| `Way_of_Working.md` · `Weekly_W0x.md` | method + weekly status reports — flat at the root, one file per topic |

Front/back flow for dev: browser → frontend container (nginx: static UI + `/api/` reverse
proxy) → FastAPI backend → MySQL. There is no direct browser-to-database path. Retired
drafts stay in each member's personal workshop.
